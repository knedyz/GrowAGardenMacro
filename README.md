# Grow a Garden Macro
Game: https://www.roblox.com/games/126884695634066/Grow-a-Garden

This is a small project I made because I am very bored. It works for me, idk if it'll work for you too but better to try.

Requires you to have:
- Automatic Mouse and Keyboard application 
- Task Scheduler
- Latest Python version
- Text Editors
- Discord Bot Token (https://discord.com/developers)
- Very Caveman knowledge using 
- 1920x1080 screen
- Electricity money

# How to use it
Explanation/instructions before you start farming.

## General
1. Install the ones in requirements.txt. (Google if you don't know to install it)
2. Make sure to have the Automatic Mouse and Keyboard (**AMK**) application installed. (https://www.robot-soft.com/mouse-keyboard-recorder.html)
   _It doesn't matter if it's cracked._
3. Along with the Automatic Mouse and Keyboard, it usually comes pre-installed with "Scheduling Tasks" application. We will be using that.
4. Download the Macro
5. Change the config in settings.json
{ 
    "TOKEN": "change-me", << Here goes your Discord Bot token.
    "CHANNEL_ID": 12345678, << Here goes your Discord Channel ID (Where you want to see the items you bought)
    "FILE_PATH": "change-me" << Here goes the file path to the "Grow a Garden Farm Stats.txt"
}

## In-game
1. put your Recall wrench on the 2nd hotbar.
2. Angle your camera where it can see both seed vendor and gear vendor. (Theres a scroll feature in the script you can activate for the perfect distance)
3. Make sure your shift-lock is off

## To begin
1. Open the Scheduling Tasks application. Add a new task:
   - ![Task Scheduler](https://i.imgur.com/aVZFppW.png)
   - On the "Script File", browse to the .amk macro script and select it.
   - Change the time to your current time's nearest 5 minute mark.
     (_ex. if you current time is 3:57, your closest time will be 4:00. So put 4:00._)
   - Your settings should look like this (I am not showing my path).

   - Press Okay on both. Now your script is running on a timer.
